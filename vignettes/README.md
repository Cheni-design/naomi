### Vignettes

Vignettes in this directory are generated by make, if you want to edit the vignettes edit the source files in `src`. The source files are
* `src/data-model.Rmd`
* `src/model-workflow.R`

Use `make vignettes` to generate make. This will:

* Copy `src/data-model.Rmd` to `data-model.Rmd`
* Spin `src/model-workflow.R` to `src/model-workflow.Rmd`
* Knit `src/model-workflow.Rmd` to `src/model-workflow.md` and a folder of figures
* Copy `src/model-workflow.md` and `src/figure` directory to `model-workflow.Rmd` and `figure` respectively
* Knit `data-model.Rmd` and `model-workflow.Rmd` the latter of which has no executable code

We do it this way as travis was having problems running the `model-workflow` vignette so we knit this locally and build the version on travis without any executable code.
